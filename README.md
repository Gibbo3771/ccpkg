* 🔍 [Search and browse packages](https://ccpkg.brawcode.com)

An early work in progress for a package manager specifically for Computer Craft (CC).

## Features
Features are being put in quite frequently, so far we support the following operations:

* Add and remove packages using formula definitions
* Package versioning (no auto diffing)
* Startup configuration to autoload paths
* Package caching
* Master list maintained via CI
* List and search commands
* Colored output and extensive logging

&nbsp;


## Planned features

There is quite a few things missing that I want to get around to doing.

* Pre and Post installation hooks
* Resolve dependencies
* Additional fields in formula such as liscence, email, contributors etc
* Query said master list to provide autocomplete functions
